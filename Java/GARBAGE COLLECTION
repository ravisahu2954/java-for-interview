Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects. To do so, we were using free() function in C language and delete() in C++. But, in java it is performed automatically. So, java provides better memory management. Advantage of Garbage Collection.
